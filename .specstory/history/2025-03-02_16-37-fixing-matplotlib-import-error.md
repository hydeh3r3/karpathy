# Installing matplotlib

The error `No module named 'matplotlib'` indicates that the matplotlib package is not installed in your Python environment. This is why you're seeing the import error.

To resolve this issue, you need to install matplotlib using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

Or if you're using conda:

```bash
conda install matplotlib
```

After installing the package, restart your Jupyter kernel and run the notebook again. The import error should be resolved.

J) Install matplotlib with pip and restart the kernel
K) Install matplotlib with conda if you're using a conda environment
L) Check if you're using the correct Python environment in Jupyter
